## CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1, was a favorite because I was always curious how GIFs work. I had no idea that they could be programmed the way that we did in the lab. I think that it was really interesting using different skills and applying them to our programming. 

Lab 11

    Lab 10, part 1, was another favorite because we were able to program to calculate the area of a rectangle. This is such a simple task that one would believe to be quick, but behind the scenes it took a while for us to accomplish. It’s cool how you don’t know the extent to which computer science can help us in the real world. 

Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1, was another favorite because it took a lab that we had previously completed and had us program the game in a different way. Through this I learned that programming is more than just a right or wrong answer. There are different ways to do things depending on the individual  I think that this is super interesting.
